## üíª Technologies Used

* **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

## üåê APIs Used

ClimaCast integrates with two external APIs to provide its functionality:

1.  **Visual Crossing Weather API**
    * **Purpose:** Fetches comprehensive weather data, including current conditions, daily forecasts, temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation probability, and more.
    * **API Key:** This API requires an API key. In the provided code, `const API_KEY = 'YOUR_VISUAL_CROSSING_API_KEY';` is where your Visual Crossing API key is placed. **Remember to keep your API key secure in a real-world production environment (e.g., using environment variables).**
    * **Website:** [https://www.visualcrossing.com/](https://www.visualcrossing.com/)

2.  **REST Countries API**
    * **Purpose:** Retrieves country information, specifically the flag image URL, based on the country name identified from the weather data's resolved address.
    * **API Key:** For the specific version used (`v3.1`) and its current usage in this project (fetching flag URLs by name), this API **does NOT require an API key or account creation**.
    * **Website:** [https://restcountries.com/](https://restcountries.com/)
